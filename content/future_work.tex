\section{Future Work} \label{future_work}
In this section several proposition for future work and state-of-the-art improvements are proposed. The goal of ENCORE \cite{ENCOREweb} project aligns with research opportunities presented in this paper. Multitude of applications such as formation flight, simultaneous exploration and physical interaction with architectural structures are well within the scope of this project. Applying passivity-based control in a real-world environment implies solving inevitable communication issues such as time-delay or internet-like errors. In other words, designing a compliant multi-agent control method immune to communication unreliability while achieving energetic passivity.
