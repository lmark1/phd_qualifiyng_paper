\section{Geometric Mechanics and Control}

Geometric control concept is well known in aerial robotics community, and has previously been applied for classic quadrotor vehicles in \cite{LeeClanak4}, \cite{LeeClanak3}, \cite{LeeClanak1}, \cite{Kumar}. The UAV is considered to be in plus configuration (body-fixed frame is aligned with UAV arms) and the CoG coincides with the body of the UAV. Furthermore, the model of the UAV is augmented with the CoG dynamics so we can exploit manipulator movement for attitude tracking. In our previous work we designed and implemented the Moving Mass Control concept (MMC) \cite{movingMass1}. In that paper we use a standard quadrotor UAV with mounted moving masses on the arms of the UAV while the control structure uses standard PID blocks. This is a novel concept first developed in \cite{movingMass2} with attitude control considered in \cite{movingMass3}. Up to this point, nonlinear geometric control has not been applied to the moving-mass controlled UAV.
