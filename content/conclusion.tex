\section{Conclusion} \label{section:conclusion}
In this paper a survey on manifold-based UAV control methods is given. The focus is on geometric mechanics as well as the passive-decomposition framework. Both operate on the underlying SE(3) quadrotor configuration with appropriate modifications when endowed with n-DoF manipulators or cables carrying a payload. \\
The original geometric control concept is generally applied for trajectory tracking purposes for various configuration parts, i.e. UAV or payload center of mass. Other applications include time optimal trajectory or attitude tracking on the given configuration manifold. \\
Passive-decomposition opens a multitude of utilization opportunities by introducing a generalized rigid body control framework while enforcing energetic-passivity of the closed-loop system. Passivity-based control methods are applied in various research projects such as trajectory tracking of a quadrotor-manipulator system, physical environment interaction, achieving compliant behavior of UAVs, formation control, inspection etc. \\
Current state-of-the-art methods are presented for both of the mentioned control frameworks.
